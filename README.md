# TypeScript Cartesify DApp Template

**Cartesify requires TypeScript 5**

**Creating the frontend with create-react-app script is discouraged as it will create a project with Typescript 4**

This is a Sunodo template for Typescript Cartesi DApps.
It uses node to execute the backend application. The application entrypoint is the `src/index.ts` file. It is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but any bundler can be used.
